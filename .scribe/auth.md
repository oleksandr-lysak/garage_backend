# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer Bearer {YOUR_JWT_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

Use your JWT access token in the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.
